## cargoJSON
cargoJSON is a message definition and format that has been defined and is owned by CHAMP to enable the air cargo industry stakeholders (airlines, handlers, forwarders, shippers, consignees, customs, truckers) to use as a means of exchanging air cargo data in a modern and open way. 

CHAMPs cargoJSON is compatible with all existing cargo data sets (IATA CARGOIMP and XML) and covers the key documents and processes in the industry (Master and House Air Waybill, Tracking, Schedules, Availability, Booking, Manifest, Airmail). cargoJSON can and will be extendible to cover the progress in the industry in terms of data coverage and technologies.
